<h1 class="my-3">Free Support</h1>

<p>Our goal at LupusVote is to provide you with the highest quality election services at <a href="/pricing">affordable prices</a> (many elections are start from 100Ks). To achieve our goals, LupusVote is completely self-service. Just about everything you need to know to run an election is available in our <a href="/help/overview">online documentation</a> or can be determined by running a free election.</p>

<p>Where our documentation is unclear or incomplete or the unlikely event that LupusVote is not functioning correctly, we are happy to answer your questions.</p>

<p>To obtain free support from us, we ask that you do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>read our documentation,</li>
<li>run a test election,</li>
<li>ask a clear and specific question,</li>
<li>be respectful, and</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do, then we will happily answer you question. We frequently respond in less than an hour and otherwise in less than 24 hours. If you haven't done the above, then you may not hear back from us.</p>

<p>For questions about payments or sensitive information,
send an email to team@<span style="display:none;">whatever</span>lupusvote.com.<p>

<h2>Paid Support</h2>
